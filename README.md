# Javascript_Question_Practice

## General Guide

The following exercises are based on: [Wilson Ren's Notion](https://yuhsien.notion.site/JS-Practice-a692c4dc450c476a8a7d9f8fe997deda)

All the exercises are not allowed to use any JS built-in functions, such as array.sort(), reverse().
The following list of functions are not restricted:

1. toUpperCase()
2. slice()
3. splice()
4. push()
5. pop()
6. unshift() ← well, this one is okay, but not recommended because of the time complexity
7. shift() ← well, this one is okay, but not recommended because of the time complexity
